--- Part Two ---
Determine the number of trees you would encounter if,
for each of the following slopes,
you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

Right 1, down 1.
Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
Right 5, down 1.
Right 7, down 1.
Right 1, down 2.
In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively;
multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.

Multiply together the number of trees hit on each of the listed slopes.
This is the puzzle answer.
